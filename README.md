# Overview

## New Data Source

We create a new dataset of educational quality to measure human capital for countries of broader growth experiences by applying a nonlinear optimization model. We use data on voice and accountability index and rule of law index to measure democracy and law enforcement respectively. By exploiting these new data sources, we study how female human capital, law enforcement, and democracy affect GDP growth and TFP growth by controlling effects of macroeconomic factors such as inflation rate and demographic factors such as fertility rate.

## Methodology
We develop a panel fixed effect model with instrumental variables to analyze how female human capital, law enforcement, democracy, and other factors relate with the GDP growth and the TFP growth over the recent period 2000-2014. This panel fixed effects model allows us to compare changes in the growth outcomes of different countries within each period and thus control for variables varying over periods. We augmented the panel fixed effects model with the instrumental variables method to consider the endogeneity of female years of schooling.

# Results

## TFP Growth
Rule of law index, inflation rate, and life expectancy negatively correlate with the TFP growth over the recent period 2000-2014. Female years of schooling is significantly positively correlated with the TFP growth under the panel fixed effects model. The statistical significance drops under the IV estimation partly due to a higher variance of the IV estimator, while the positive correlation between female years of schooling and the TFP growth increases under IV estimation. Also, student assessment test score positively correlates with the TFP growth under the smaller sample of more developed countries from 2000 to 2010. One standard deviation increase in assessment test score relates with 5.01 percent increase in the TFP growth.
 
## GDP Growth
Democracy index and inflation rate negatively correlates with the GDP growth over the recent period 2000-2014. GDP per capita and government consumption ratio are not significantly correlated with the GDP growth under the full sample. However, they become negatively correlated with the GDP growth when we drop the period 2010-2014 and less developed countries for analysis.
