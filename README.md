# Overview

## New Data Source

We create a new dataset of educational quality to measure human capital for countries of broader growth experiences by applying a nonlinear optimization model (1). We also use data on voice and accountability index (democracy index) and rule of law index to measure democracy and law enforcement respectively. By exploiting these new data sources, we study how female human capital, law enforcement, and democracy affect GDP growth and TFP growth by controlling effects of macroeconomic factors such as inflation rate and demographic factors such as fertility rate.

## Methodology
We develop a panel fixed effect model with instrumental variables to analyze how female human capital, law enforcement, democracy, and other factors relate with the GDP growth and the TFP growth over the recent period 2000-2014. This panel fixed effects model allows us to compare changes in the growth outcomes of different countries within each period and thus control for variables varying over periods. We augmented the panel fixed effects model with the instrumental variables method to consider the endogeneity of female years of schooling.
